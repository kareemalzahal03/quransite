# Al-Quran: Word Insights

A powerful tool designed to help you explore the language, structure, and depth of every word in the Quran.

Rooted in the legacy of the Quranic Arabic Corpus, this site uses an enriched extension to bring linguistic insights directly to your fingertips. As you read, simply click on any word to view features like morphology breakdown, advanced word search, and examples of the root word in other contexts.

This project is inspired by the vision of Dr. Kais Dukes, creator of the Quranic Corpus. By building on the latest open-source version of the Corpus, QuranWord aims to carry that legacy forward — offering new generations of readers and learners a way to engage deeply with the divine text.

Whether you’re a student, a scholar, or someone exploring the Quran with curiosity and love, we invite you to experience the Quran like never before — one word at a time.
